    const text = `Based on the provided cases, it appears that there is a split in opinions on the issue of abortion.

In the case of <ref>Planned Parenthood South Atlantic v. State of South Carolina</ref>, the court held that a statute that prohibits the performance of surgical abortions by certain medical professionals, but allows medication abortions to be performed by them, is unconstitutional as applied to those medical professionals.

On the other hand, in <ref>The Lilith Fund for Reproductive Equity v. Mark Lee Dickson and Right to Life East Texas</ref>, the court upheld a Texas law that prohibited certain medical professionals from performing abortions, even when confronted with a pregnant woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy.

There is also a precedent set in the case of <ref>Virginia ex rel. Cuccinelli v. Sebelius</ref>, where the court ruled that a provision of the Affordable Care Act that required insurance companies to cover certain abortion services was unconstitutional.

Additionally, the case of <ref>Moms for Liberty - Brevard County, FL v. Brevard Public Schools</ref> highlights the ongoing debate on reproductive rights, as the issue of parental notice requirements for minors seeking abortion services is a contentious one.

These cases illustrate the complexity and the ongoing debate surrounding the issue of abortion in the United States.`;
